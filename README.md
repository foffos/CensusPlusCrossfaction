# CensusPlus
### Modified to implement crossfaction search and show results in extended UI

### What is this?
this is a slightly modified version of "CensusPlus", many of the private cataclysm servers have implemented crossfaction to improve the gaming experience, this version of CensusPlus expands the character search and visualization to both factions.

The value of MAX_WHO_RESULTS is preconfigured at 48, in order to bypass the limitation of 49 results set in many private servers.
