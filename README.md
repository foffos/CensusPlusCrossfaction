# CensusPlus
### Modified for Hades Cataclysm server<br><br>

### What is this?<br>
CensusPlus is a relatively popular addon created for World of Warcraft, particularly throughout the Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm expansions. However, work on the addon stopped around the time that Cataclysm was released, so the functionality of it is minimal. The addon is supposed to query the entire server, then give detailed results about the popularion, class, race, and level distribution of the server population. This was thwarted by one problem: The way CensusPlus performs queries does not work properly on Blizzard's retail servers. Moreover, it does not work on Twinstar's Hades server (www.hades-wow.com). This repo is created to making the addon work properly and efficently for the Hades server, for use by the Hades staff.
